I particularly love the recent developments in making coding accessible to musicians. [This](https://riemannkollektion.com/blogs/techno-producer-knowledge-hub/max-for-live-the-techno-producers-guide) is an article that dives into one of the most popular coding environments for musicians, which is called Max for Live.

I like that this article gives a bit of a background to what Max is, and why it is important for musicians to know that it exists! What is especially cool is how the interface for Max is purposely similar to how one would patch cables into an analog synth. I think the fact that Max is a visual coding environment is especially important for artists.

Reading this article made me appreciate, again, the importance of UI/UX design, especially in complex applications. The ability to simulate the real world hardware interactions visually on an application is paramount to the success of any large scale music production application. Using Max for Live in Ableton allows producers to create a working environment fully customizable, akin to a setup that they might have in hardware, or they can pay a programmer to create the tool that they are specifically looking for.

The last thing any musician would like to do is to take a break from the creative process and figure out where some feature is located in an application. I believe Max for Live and Ableton allow musicians to create the prefect ecosystem suited for themselves where they don't need to think abut locating a feature, and get lost in the "zone" of the creative process, while also allowing easy access to any feature for experimentation.
